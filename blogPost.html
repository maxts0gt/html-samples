        <h2>Tesla's history</h2>
        <p>
          Tesla was founded in 2003 by a
          <strong
            >group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to
            compromise to drive electric</strong
          >
          – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive
          than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only
          <em>all-electric</em> vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean
          energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the
          world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission
          future, the better.
